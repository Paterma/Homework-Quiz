# Homework-Quiz

## My Task

At some point in my journey to become a full-stack web developer, I'll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment&mdash;perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help familiarize me with these tests and allow me to use the skills covered in this unit, this weekâ€™s homework invites me to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I'll write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## The Work

For this assignment I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to creat a quiz. I began with creating my basic html layout with buttons, a timer, a link to view highscores, and some verbage. Then I created basic CSS to style my quiz box. After that I created a javascript page when I added functions that include; click functions for when you click the start button or answers buttons, a scoring system that logs correct or incorrect answers in local storage, a prompt to ask for you initials and save your score with the initials to local storage, a timer that starts when the game begins, and deducts time when you answer a question wrong, a game ending function when all the question are answered or the timer goes to zero, and more. I also created a seperate html page that links to the "View Highscores" so you can see the scores of other users. This assignment meets all the acceptance criteria, and is full of fun JS questions!
